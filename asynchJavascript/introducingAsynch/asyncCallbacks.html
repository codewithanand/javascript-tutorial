    <h1>Asynchronous Callbacks</h1>
    <p>
        Async callbacks are functions that are specified as arguments when calling a function which will start executing code in the background. When the background code finishes running, it calls the callback function to let you know the work is done, or to let you know that something of interest has happened. Using callbacks is slightly old-fashioned
    </p>

    <button>Click me</button>

    <p>
        When we pass a callback function as an argument to another function, we are only passing the function's reference as an argument, i.e, the callback function is not executed immediately. It is “called back” (hence the name) asynchronously somewhere inside the containing function’s body. The containing function is responsible for executing the callback function when the time comes.

    <!-- Javascript here -->
    <script>
        let btn = document.querySelector('button');
        btn.addEventListener('click', () => {
            alert('You clicked me!');

            let pElem = document.createElement('p');
            pElem.textContent = 'This is a newly-added paragraph.';
            document.body.appendChild(pElem);
        });
    </script>
