    <h1>ECMAScript 2015 Classes</h1>
    <p>
        Unlike old-school constructor functions where the new operator does the initialization of this to a newly-allocated object, this isn't automatically initialized for a class defined by the extends keyword, i.e the sub-classes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore running the above code will give an error:
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Uncaught ReferenceError:</b> Must call <em>super</em> constructor <em>in</em> derived <em>class</em> before accessing <em>'this'</em> or returning <em>from</em> derived constructor
    </p>
    <p>
        For sub-classes, the this initialization to a newly allocated object is always dependant on the parent class constructor, i.e the constructor function of the class from which you're extending.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here we are extending the Person class â€” the Teacher sub-class is an extension of the Person class. So for Teacher, the this initialization is done by the Person constructor.
    </p>
    <p>
        To call the parent constructor we have to use the super() operator, like so:
    </p>
    <p>
        class Teacher extends Person { <br>
            constructor(subject, grade) { <br>
              super(); // Now 'this' is initialized by calling the parent constructor. <br>
              this.subject = subject; <br>
              this.grade = grade; <br>
            } <br>
        } <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Since the super() operator is actually the parent class constructor, passing it the necessary arguments of the Parent class constructor will also initialize the parent class properties in our sub-class, thereby inheriting it:
    </p>
    <p>
        class Teacher extends Person { <br>
            constructor(first, last, age, gender, interests, subject, grade) { <br>
              super(first, last, age, gender, interests); <br>
          
              // subject and grade are specific to Teacher <br>
              this.subject = subject; <br>
              this.grade = grade; <br>
            } <br>
        } <br>
    </p>
